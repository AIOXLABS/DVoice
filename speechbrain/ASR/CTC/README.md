# DVoice ASR with CTC based Seq2Seq models.
This folder contains scripts necessary to run an ASR experiment with the DVoice dataset: [Link](https://zenodo.org/record/6342622)

# Data preparation
[DVoice](https://dvoice.ma) attempts to provide automatic voice processing solutions for African languages and dialects. We use preprocessing techniques including voice augmentation to fill the data gap for each language.

# How to run
python train.py hparams/{hparam_file}.py

# Languages
Here is a list of the different languages or dialects that we tested within the DVoice dataset and CTC:
- Darija
- Swahili (upcoming soon)

# Results

## How to simply use pretrained models to transcribe my audio file?

SpeechBrain provides a simple interface to transcribe audio files with pretrained models. All the necessary information can be found on the different HuggingFace repositories (see the results table above) corresponding to our different models for DVoice.
